USE CASE DESCRIPTION:

I'm building QuantumViz Agent for the AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon - an educational platform that teaches quantum computing using Amazon Braket.

WHAT BEDROCK DOES:
When students build quantum circuits (using gates like Hadamard, CNOT, etc.), Bedrock generates plain-English explanations of what the circuit does, which quantum concepts are involved, and expected results.

EXAMPLE:
- Student creates: H gate + CNOT gate circuit
- Bedrock explains: "This creates a Bell State demonstrating quantum entanglement. The qubits become correlated, so measuring one affects the other. You'll see 50% |00⟩ and 50% |11⟩."

USAGE:
- 10-50 AI explanations per user session
- ~300-500 tokens per explanation
- Educational content only, no PII
- Hackathon deadline approaching

MODELS NEEDED:
Amazon Titan Text (preferred) or any available model - I can adapt my code.

This is purely educational for the hackathon. Need access ASAP to complete the project.
